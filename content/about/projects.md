## My main personal project

My main project is a game engine that is based on [my research paradigm](./philosophy). I've started working on it
in 2021, but I've started from scratch two times since that time due to discovering ideas how I could make my project 
a lot better and more useful.

{{% notice style="primary" title="Kan" %}}
Kan is the current iteration, which is written in pure C. Pure C was choosen due to fast compile times, light weight of 
artefacts and "directness" of the code: you can read the code and understand its weight, that is not hidden under layers 
of templates and abstraction. Despite using "old-style pure C", Kan utilizes autogenerated reflection to be as robust 
and convenient as possible without losing advantages of pure C.

As of May 2024, Kan core logic and architecture is implemented and I'm working on adding modules required to make games,
like transform, render and resource system.

## My other personal projects

My path in game development started when I was 14 years old and I had lots of different pet projects along the way.
I will list some of them just for historical reasons from newer ones to older ones.

{{% notice style="primary" title="CMake Unit Framework" %}}
Basic CMake framework for modular libraries, applications and frameworks, that is used in Kan and its previous 
iteration -- Emergence.

{{% notice style="primary" title="Emergence" %}}
Previous iteration of my game engine project. It's core is implemented along with 2d render and physics integrations. 
It was abandoned, because some architecture design mistakes that were made during early development started to hinder 
development and cost too much.

{{% notice style="primary" title="Sober" %}}
CMake framework for modular libraries and frameworks, that was initially used for Emergence. Although it didn't go well 
in the end, it is still interesting from design point of view and its best ideas have formed CMakeUnitFramework.

{{% notice style="primary" title="as-bind-gen" %}}
Tool for generating AngelScript bindings for Urho3D engine, made for Colonization project. My first experience in making 
build tools, here just for historical reasons.
