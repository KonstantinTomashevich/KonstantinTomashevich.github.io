## Who am I?

I prefer to call myself a hedge knight of game programming, because I am more of a generalist rather than specialized 
developer. I've worked both as gameplay and engine developer and I have experience with various engines and 
technologies. It gives me good understanding of the common concepts and approaches in game development. But it also
makes me not qualified enough for roles that require 5+ in some particular game engine.

## Ultimate skill

Question of "my ultimate skill" (in RPG terms) is as dualistic as my experience.

From one point of view, my experience lets me dig into code that has no documentation and "no living witnesses" and
still understand, fix and improve it when it is needed. I've worked with different technologies including custom
proprientary engines with almost zero documentation (and developers who forgot why they've written it like that),
therefore I'm able to see code as it is without prejustice and excessive expectations, then examine it and find ways 
to make it better for our project goals. Is there a thing in your project that no one knows how it works, but you need
to optimize it? I can do it, but I'm not usually enjoying doing that.

On the other hand, I like to design and implement new features and systems. It is sometimes exhausting, but it is also
much more fun than digging into old code. I've developed lots of different features for gameplay and I'm developing
my own game engine as a pet project, therefore there is a lot of invested experience points in this stat too.

To summarize, it looks like I am some kind of dwarf. I'm digging and building underground fortresses.
